📚 Python Assignments – File Handling | PDF Extraction | Regex | DB | Threading | OOP

This repository contains a series of Python-based assignments that progressively cover file handling, PDF data extraction, regular expressions, SQL database integration, multithreading, API consumption, and OOP concepts using Jupyter Notebook.

All projects were developed using Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda Navigator).

🧠 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

PyPDF2, re (Regular Expressions), os, threading

SQL Server + pyodbc for database connection

OOP Concepts (abstract classes, inheritance, polymorphism)

RSS feed parsing via xml.etree.ElementTree

requests (HTTP)
